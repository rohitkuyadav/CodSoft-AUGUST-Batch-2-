Here is a brief description of the Python code for a To-Do List application:

This code creates a GUI-based To-Do List application using the Tkinter module in Python. 

It starts by importing necessary modules like tkinter, messagebox, ttk and others.

A main window is created and titled "To-Do List". The geometry (size) is set to 400x250 pixels.

A Listbox widget is created to hold the list of tasks. This allows displaying a scrollable list.

An Entry widget is created to allow entering new tasks to add.

Two functions are defined - add_task() to add new tasks to the Listbox, and delete_task() to delete selected tasks.

Validation is added to check task is not empty before adding. Message boxes display warnings as needed.

The iconphoto method sets a custom icon for the window using an image file.

A menu bar is created but no menus yet. 

Two Button widgets are created to trigger the add and delete functions.

The menu bar is displayed and the main loop started to launch the GUI.

Overall, it provides a basic GUI window with a task list, entry box, menu bar and buttons to add and delete tasks in a simple To-Do list app.
