Calculator Program using PySimpleGUI
Introduction

This program implements a simple calculator GUI application in Python using the PySimpleGUI module. It allows performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Imports

The PySimpleGUI module is imported for building the GUI. This provides an easier interface compared to Tkinter for creating simple GUIs.

python

Copy code
import PySimpleGUI as sg

GUI Layout

The layout for the calculator is defined as a list of rows, each containing Button elements and one Input element.

    The Input element at the top shows the calculation expression and result.
    Buttons for digits 0-9 are used to enter numbers.
    Operator buttons +, -, x, / perform arithmetic operations.
    Clear button clears the input.
    '=' button evaluates the expression and displays result.

This layout is passed to PySimpleGUI Window to create the actual GUI.
Event Loop

A while True loop is used to handle events and update the GUI.

    When a digit button is clicked, it is appended to the 'expression' variable and shown in the Input.
    When an operator is clicked, it gets appended to the expression.
    Clicking '=' evaluates the expression using eval() and updates the result in Input.
    Pressing 'Clear' resets the expression and Input.
    Win_Closed event closes the window and ends program.

Key Functions

    update(): Updates specified Input element with given value
    eval(): Evaluates the input expression string as Python code
    str(): Converts result to string to display in Input

Usage

The user can click digits and operators to build an expression, and press '=' to evaluate the result. Clear button resets the calculator.

This provides a simple yet functional calculator GUI without using Tkinter module. The logic can be enhanced to add more features.
