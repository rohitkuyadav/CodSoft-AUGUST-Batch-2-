Here is a documentation for the random password generator code:

# Random Password Generator

## Introduction

This is a command line based random password generator program written in Python. It generates passwords of given length with a combination of different types of characters.

## Imports

The following modules are imported:

- random - Generates pseudo-random numbers
- string - Contains constants of ascii character strings

```python
import random
import string
```

## Input

The program prompts the user to enter the desired length of the password. This is read as an integer input.

```python 
size = int(input("Enter password length: "))
```

## Character Sets

Different constants from the string module are used to create sets of possible characters to include in the password.

- Lowercase letters
- Uppercase letters 
- Digits
- Special symbols/punctuation

```python
lower_chr = string.ascii_lowercase 
upper_chr = string.ascii_uppercase
num = string.digits
symbols = string.punctuation
```

## Password Generation

The 4 character sets are concatenated to form a single string of all possible characters. 

The random.sample() function is used to select k random characters from this string based on the input password length.

These sampled characters are joined together into the final random password string.

```python
all = lower_chr + upper_chr + num + symbols
password = "".join(random.sample(all,size)) 
```

## Output

The generated password is printed for the user.

```python
print(f"Generated Password is: {password}")
```

The password contains a random combination of lower, upper, numeric and special characters based on the user input length.

This provides a simple command line random password generator in Python.
