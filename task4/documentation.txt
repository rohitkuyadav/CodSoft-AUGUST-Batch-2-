Here is a documentation for the weather application code:

# Weather Application

## Overview
This is a Python GUI application to fetch and display weather information for a given city using OpenWeatherMap API.

## Imports
The code imports required Python modules:

- tkinter - For building GUI
- requests - To make API calls 
- json - To parse API response
- messagebox - For displaying popup messages

## API Setup
An API key from OpenWeatherMap is stored in a variable to be used in API calls.

## GUI Window
The main application window is created using Tkinter. Labels, entry box and buttons are added for taking user input and displaying weather data.

## Weather Data Function 
A function `get_weather()` is defined to call API, parse response and update GUI.

- City name is read from input box
- API URL is prepared with API key and city name
- JSON response is parsed to extract weather details like temperature, humidity, description
- The weather details are shown in the label by updating its text
- Appropriate error is displayed for invalid city name

## Event Binding
The button click calls the `get_weather()` function to fetch and display weather data.

## Output
The application shows the current temperature, humidity and weather condition for a given city. It validates input and handles errors.

## Enhancements
- Show 5-day forecast data
- Add weather icons 
- Allow adding multiple cities
- Store previously fetched data
- Deploy as executable application

So in summary, it provides a simple GUI app to display live weather data using OpenWeatherMap API in Python.
